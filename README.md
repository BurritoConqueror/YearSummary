# YearSummary
This year in IOS I learned a lot. At first I was a bit rusty because last year was the last time I had used xcode. I started on a couple small projects to refamiliarize myself with xcode. At first it was it was just moving sprites around on the screen, but eventually I started working on a pool game. While working on the pool game I learned about SKActions inorder to make the balls dissapear when the went into the holes. After I felt I had learned everything I could from the pool game I moved on to making an air hockey game. While making the air hockey game I ran into a couple of issues. The first of which was the movement of the hitters. The way I had been moving the sprites in the past was to set the position of the sprites to the location of the touch. However, when you just set the position of the sprite it doesn't carry any momentum, so the puck would just stop when It got hit by the hitters. In order to fix it I assigned velocity to the hitter based on the difference in locations between the hitter and where the touch was. Another Issue I faced was detecting the contact between the the puck and the nets. I solved it by learning about contact delegates. I assigned different contact bit masks to the different goals. Whenever two sprites collided I would check if the contac bit masks of the sprites were equal to the contact bit masks of one of the goals and the puck, if they were I would assign a point to one of the players according to which goal was scored on. After I finished my air hockey app we began our group projects. At first my group wasted a lot of time trying to decide on what kind of app we should make. It was really hard for us to communicate with eachother because we were all on quarantine and couldn't talk to eachother face to face anymore. Eventually we decided on trying to make a really big card game. However after trying to start creating the game we realized that we bit fof more than we could chew. After some more brainstorming we came up with the idea of Corona Maps. It was an app that would show you the location of people around you and send you a notification if you were within 6 feet of another person to help people social distance. First we researched how to get and display the users location on the phone. After we found how to add annotations to the map with the idea that each annotation was another persons location. After we tried to get the users trade locations through bluetooth and multipeer connectivity. However, when we were testing getting the devices connected we didn't have enough phones on a low enough IOS to install the app and we couldn't update xcode because we needed the admin password. Whenever we tried to connect one of our devices to the simulator the app would say connection declined. So, instead we tried to have the phones receive and pass locations through a database.
